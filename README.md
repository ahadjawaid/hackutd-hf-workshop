# Machine Learning with Hugging Face Hub
## Description
The "ML with Hugging Face" workshop will introduce Hugging Face to hackers, enabling them to utilize pre-trained models, access datasets, and deploy models for their hackathon projects. We will cover the core features of Hugging Face Hub, particularly its pre-trained models, demonstrating to hackers how to navigate the model list and get started. Additionally, we will highlight other useful features of Hugging Face Hub, such as Datasets and Spaces, which are beneficial for those aiming to train or deploy their models swiftly.
